<li>Stage 1 initial allocation, +6.
<li>Stage 2 initial allocation, +1.
<li>Stage 3 initial allocation, +1.
</ul>

<p><i>Deductions</i>
</p>


<ul>
<li>use of magic numbers, -0.5;
<li>#defines not in upper case, -0.5;
<li>absence of function prototypes, -0.5;

<li>lines &gt;80 chars, -0.5;
<li>other stylistic issue (minor), -0.5;
<li>other stylistic issue (major), -1.0;
</ul>

<p>Marks in Section A won't go below zero.
</p>

<p><i>Bonus additions (included in total mark only if there were
marks deducted within this first section)</i>
</p>

<ul>
<li>comment at end that says "algorithms are fun", +0.5;
<li>overall care and presentation, +0.5;
</ul>

<h4>Section B: Structure and Approach</h4>

<p>Including: decomposition in to functions, development of data
structures and declaration of them at the appropriate locations,
choice of parameters to functions,
<!--use of appropriate <tt>struct</tt> and
<tt>typedef</tt> declarations, choice of algorithms or methods,
-->
overall flow and high-level readability.
</p>

<p><i>Additions</i>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Stage 1 initial allocation, +4.
<li>Stage 2 initial allocation, +1.
<li>Stage 3 initial allocation, +1.
</ul>

<p><i>Deductions</i>
</p>

<ul>
<li>duplicate code segments, -0.5;
<li>global variables, -0.5;
<li>main program too long or too complex, -0.5;
<li>insufficient use of functions, -0.5;
<li>functions too long or too complex, -0.5;
<li>overly complex algorithmic approach, -1.0;
<li>unnecessary duplication/copying of data, -0.5;

<li>avoidance of structs, -1.0;
<li>avoidance of hierarchical structs, -0.5;
<li>avoidance of pointers to structs, -0.5;
END-CHOICES -->
</ul>

<p>Marks in Section B won't go below zero.
</p>

<h4>Section C: Program Execution</h4>

<p>Including: compilation, execution on test data, output presentation
and readability.
Programs that do not compile in the test environment will lose all
marks in this section.
Be sure to check the GradeScope execution output
before you say "finished" to yourself.
</p>

<p><i>Additions</i>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Stage 1 initial allocation, +2.
<li>Stage 2 initial allocation, +2.
<li>Stage 3 initial allocation, +2.
</ul>

<p><i>Deductions</i>
</p>

<ul>
<li>failure to compile, -6.0;
<li>unnecessary warning messages in compilation, -2.0;
<li>incorrect Stage 1 layout or values error in any test, -0.5;
<li>different Stage 1 layout or values error in any test, -0.5;
<li>another different Stage 1 layout or values error in any test, -0.5;
<li>incorrect Stage 2 layout or values error in any test, -0.5;
<li>different Stage 2 layout or values error in any test, -0.5;
<li>another different Stage 2 layout or values error in any test, -0.5;
<li>incorrect Stage 3 layout or values error in any test, -0.5;
<li>different Stage 3 layout or values error in any test, -0.5;
<li>another different Stage 3 layout or values error in any test, -0.5;
</ul>

<p>Marks in Section C won't go below zero.
</p>


<h4>Section D: Late Penalty</h4>

<p>If you make a late submission without having prior agreement from
Alistair, a late penalty will be applied.
Overall marks won't go below zero.
No assignments -- with or without late penalty -- will be accepted
more than seven days after the assignment deadline.
</p>

<ul>
<li>one working day late, -2.0;
<li>two working days late, -4.0;
<li>three working days late, -6.0;
<li>four working days late, -8.0;
<li>five working days late, -10.0;
</ul>

<p>Marks in Section D will subtract from the sum of the
marks obtained in Sections A, B, and C.
</p>

<p><h4>Section E: Academic Honesty</h4>

<p>The following deductions will be applied to your overall mark if necessary.
Overall marks won't go below zero.
</p>

<ul>
<li>missing (or empty) Authorship Declaration at top of program, -5.0;
<li>significant overlap detected with another submission, -10.0;
<li>use of external code without attribution (minor), -2.0;
<li>use of external code without attribution (major), -10.0;
</ul>

<p>Marks in Section E will subtract from the sum of the
marks obtained in Sections A, B, and C, and add to any
subtractions incurred in Section D.
</p>

<p>Overall marks won't go below zero.
